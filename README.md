# PROPOSED SYSTEM
1. Electrical port switching (on/off): User can switch ON the electrical ports and
switch OFF the electrical ports. There will be total 4 ports.
2. Automatic on/off the electrical ports: User will select Days, Start Time, Stop Time
for the particular electrical port. At selected days & time the electrical port will
automatically turned ON & turned OFF.
3. Electricity consumption monitoring: User will get the real time consumption
information in the mobile. User will get the information such as energy consumption,
power consumption, current consumption, bill (in rs). User can see the graph of the
consumption.
4. Water tank measuring: User can see the current water level of the tank on mobile.
User will be notified when the water tank will be full.
5. Air quality monitoring: User can see the current indoor Temperature, Humidity and
the AQI (Air Quality Index) on mobile.
